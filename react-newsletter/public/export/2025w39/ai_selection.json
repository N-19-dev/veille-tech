      "title": "Blog: Apache Airflow 3.1.0: Human-Centered Workflows",
      "summary": "We are thrilled to announce the release of Apache Airflow 3.1.0 , an update that puts humans at the center of data\nworkflows. This release introduces powerful new capabilities for human decision-making in automated\nprocesses, comprehensive internationalization support, and significant developer experience improvements. Details : üì¶ PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/3.1.0/ üìö Core Airflow Docs: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.1.0/ üìö Task SDK Docs: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/task-sdk/1.1.0/ üõ†Ô∏è Release Notes: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.1.0/release_notes.html ü™∂ Sources: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.1.0/installation/installing-from-sources.html üöè Constraints: https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/constraints-3.1.0 ü§ù Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): When Automation Meets Human Judgment This powerful capability bridges the gap between automated processes and human expertise, making Airflow invaluable for: AI/ML Model Validation : Pause inference pipelines for human review of model outputs Content Moderation : Route content through human reviewers before publication Approval Workflows : Require manager approval for sensitive operations Data Quality Gates : Allow data stewards to validate critical datasets HITL tasks pause in a deferred state while presenting intuitive web forms in the Airflow UI. Users with appropriate roles can review context data, DAG parameters, and XCom values before making informed decisions. Example Code: from airflow.sdk import DAG from airflow.providers.standard.operators.hitl import HITLOperator with DAG ( \"content_moderation\" , schedule = \"@daily\" ) as dag : moderate_content = HITLOperator ( task_id = \"review_content\" , message = \"Please review this content for publication\" , data_key = \"content_to_review\" ) üìä UI Enhancements & Performance Calendar and Gantt Views Make Their Comeback Remember those beloved Calendar and Gantt chart views from Airflow 2.x? They‚Äôre back, completely rebuilt for the\nmodern React UI after being omitted from the 3.0 release. The new Calendar view is genuinely interactive with filtering capabilities that make it easy to drill down\ninto specific time periods and dag states. The Gantt chart is now integrated directly into the grid view and renders much faster than the old\nversion, giving you that timeline perspective without the performance headaches. Theme Updates That Actually Matter We‚Äôve refreshed the color palette using modern design principles, making the UI more consistent, professional\nand most of all taken a careful look at contrast ratios so the UI should be more accessible. Other Improvements We‚Äôve added a lot more filtering options across the pages! Plus, you can now pin your favorite DAGs to keep them at the top of your list or to filter for them easily. It‚Äôs\none of those small features that makes a huge difference when dealing with 100s of workflows. Credited to Volker Janz. üìä UI Development Milestone : Airflow 3.1.0 features 5x more UI pull requests than the 2.10 release and 50% more than Airflow 3.0, demonstrating the community‚Äôs commitment to user experience excellence. ‚è∞ Deadline Alerts : Proactive Workflow Monitoring Say goodbye to reactive monitoring. Deadline Alerts provide proactive notifications when DAG runs\nexceed time thresholds, helping ensure SLA compliance and timely completion of critical workflows. Configure monitoring by specifying: Reference point : DAG queued time, logical date, or fixed datetime Interval : Time threshold (positive or negative) Callback : Notifications via Airflow Notifiers or custom functions Example Code: from datetime import timedelta from airflow.sdk.definitions.deadline import DeadlineAlert , DeadlineReference , AsyncCallback from airflow.providers.slack.notifications.slack_webhook import SlackWebhookNotifier with DAG ( \"critical_etl\" , deadline = DeadlineAlert ( reference = DeadlineReference . DAGRUN_QUEUED_AT , interval = timedelta ( hours = 2 ), callback = AsyncCallback ( SlackWebhookNotifier , kwargs = { \"text\" : \"üö® Critical ETL missed deadline!\" } ) ) ) as dag : # Your tasks here Perfect for monitoring daily ETLs, alerting before critical deadlines, or escalating resource-constrained workflows. üåç Going Global with 17 Languages Airflow now speaks your team‚Äôs language. Literally. We have added comprehensive internationalization support\nfor 17 languages , including Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Spanish and more. The interface detects your\nbrowser preferences automatically, but you can switch languages on the fly without refreshing the page. For our Arabic and Hebrew users, we‚Äôve built in proper right-to-left (RTL) support The best part? We have made it straightforward for the community to contribute additional languages with clear\ncontribution guidelines, so this is just the beginning of Airflow‚Äôs global reach. üé® Build your Airflow , your way The new React Plugin System ( AIP-68 ) transforms how you extend Airflow‚Äôs interface. We have replaced\nthe old Flask-based approach with a modern toolkit that lets you customize Airflow exactly how your team works. Want to embed your company‚Äôs dashboard right in the Airflow UI? Build React applications or iframes that will\nrender inside Airflow‚Äôs (nav bar, dashboard, details page, etc). Want to link to your existing tools\nseamlessly? Create custom external links to your resources. Want to extend Airflow‚Äôs API server? Register\nFastAPI sub applications and middlewares that fit your specific processes. The system includes: External Views for linking to existing tools (external links or embedded iframes) React Applications support for rendering external react apps FastAPI Sub Applications to extend the API server Root Middlewares for intercepting API requests (even core ones) We‚Äôve already seen teams integrate everything from Wikipedia searches to data lineage\nvisualizations to yes, someone building a snake game to play while waiting on dag runs! Credited to Tamara Fingerlin. üîß Enhanced Developer and Authoring Experience Task SDK Evolution Airflow 3.1 advances the decoupling of the Task SDK from Airflow Core through improved DAG serialization. While\ncomplete separation arrives in 3.2.0, the foundation enables: Independent Upgrades : Reduced coordination need between Dag authors and Airflow Ops teams Forward Compatibility : Dag authors should now write Dags by importing from the airflow.sdk namespace for future-proofing. (Naturally, the old imports still work but issue a warning.) Deployment Flexibility : Better support for separated component deployment Python 3.13 Support Airflow 3.1.0 adds Python 3.13 support while removing Python 3.9 (end-of-life). The platform now supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. Inference Execution A new streaming API endpoint ( /dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns/{dag_run_id}/wait ) allows applications to watch DAG runs\nuntil completion, enabling responsive integration patterns for real-time workflows. The below example use httpx to trigger a dag run, and emits the final dag run\nstate after it finishes: import asyncio import json import httpx dag_id = \"my-dag\" async def create_and_wait ( client ): # Create a dag run... r = await client . post ( f \"https://my-airflow.example.com/api/v2/dags/ { dag_id } /dagRuns\" ) run_id = r . json ()[ \"dag_run_id\" ] async with client . stream ( \"GET\" , f \"https://my-airflow.example.com/api/v2/dags/ { dag_id } /dagRuns/ { run_id } /wait\" , ) as r : async for line in r . aiter_lines (): pass # You can do progress report here instead. print ( \"Dag run state:\" , json . loads ( line . strip ())[ \"state\" ]) async def main (): async with httpx . AsyncClient () as client : await create_and_wait ( client ) asyncio . run ( main ()) üôè Amazing Community Apache Airflow 3.1.0 represents an extraordinary community effort, showcasing the vibrant ecosystem that drives this project forward with 163 contributors making this release possible across 1,400+ commits .
